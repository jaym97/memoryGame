# Memory Card Matching Game

## How to Play

You play the game by clicking (or tapping on mobile) a card and then try to guess where on the deck its match is and click on it as well. Keep making guesses until all cards are matched. Each guess counts as a move. Try to match all cards in as few moves as possible. Good luck!
